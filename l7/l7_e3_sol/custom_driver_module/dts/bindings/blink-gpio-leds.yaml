  A generic binding for a GPIO-controlled blinking LED. Note that this binding
  has no vendor prefix, as it does not target a specific device or vendor.

  Example definition in devicetree:

    blink-gpio-led {
        compatible = "blink-gpio-led";
        led-gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        blink-period-ms = <1000>;
    };

#STEP 1.1
compatible: "blink-gpio-led"

include: base.yaml

#STEP 1.2
properties:
  led-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO-controlled LED.

#STEP 1.3
  blink-period-ms:
    type: int
    description: Initial blinking period in milliseconds.
